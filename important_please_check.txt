"First.html" has code that we did in our first few classes and "first_output" is the output of the code

"second.html" has code that we did after completion of "first.html" and "second_output" is the output of the code

similar is the case for third.html,fourth.html,fifth.html and third_output,fourth_output,fifth_output respectively
